# Agentic AI and Generative AI Project

## Overview

Welcome to my **Agentic AI and Generative AI** project! This repository contains code and resources related to the development of intelligent conversational agents using tools like **Langchain** and the **Gemma 2B** model via **Ollama**. The focus of this project is to explore Agentic AI's potential in creating autonomous, task-driven systems that can understand and act on user inputs.

## Key Features

- **Gemma 2B Model Integration**: Built a simple app that uses the Gemma 2B model via Ollama.
- **ChatPromptTemplate**: Implemented a structured approach for handling smart questions and inputs.
- **Langchain Output Parsers**: Utilized Langchain to streamline AI responses and improve user interactions.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Developed an interactive web app to showcase the functionality of the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Langchain**
- **Streamlit**
- **Gemma 2B model via Ollama**
- **ChatPromptTemplate**
- **Ollama**

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Ollama (for Gemma model)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aadi-stack/openai.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd openai

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. If you don't have Streamlit installed, you can install it via:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit

5. To run the web app, use the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

# Usage

Once everything is set up, open the web app in your browser and start interacting with the AI agent. You can input different questions, and the model will generate intelligent responses based on the context provided.

#Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request if you would like to contribute to the project. Contributions in the form of bug fixes, features, or documentation improvements are always welcome!
